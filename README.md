# Portfolio

This is a portfolio website built with React and Vite. The site showcases my projects, skills, work experience, and provides a contact form for visitors to reach out to me. The project is still under construction, but I am using it to test various tools and technologies such as Jenkins, CI/CD, automated testing, and Docker.
